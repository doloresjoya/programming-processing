# programming-processing
My code examples from <a href='https://processing.org/'>Processing 2nd Edition</a>, <a href='https://github.com/doloresjoya/programming-processing.git'>A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists</a>. Processing is a great language for visual artists and the best foundation I've found. These are examples I wrote directly from the exercises in the book.
